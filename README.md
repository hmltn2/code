# code
A central place for general online coding stuff I do. My aim is to centralize all of my coding and general ongoing projects here.

Projects:

1. slowly start exploring a system to convert turkish into some (arbitrary) "deep structure". (try to ask this hard question on theoretical computer science: is there some topic where you compare two languages or codes, and decide what deep structure they share - but then, you can do it again, for two deep structures? some principle like, any two languages or codes can imply a shared underlying code? fascinating question /topic)


Stupid to-do:

1. clean up github (from the command line)
2. consider making your own (command line?) mind-mapping software (to be used for your own tasks, intents, purposes, etc.)
